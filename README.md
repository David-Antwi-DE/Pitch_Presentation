# Pitch_Presentation

### Phase 1 Final Presentation Brief
In this phase, you'll pitch your project idea to stakeholders in a clear, non-technical manner. Your goal is to communicate the value and potential of your project effectively.

### Instructions
Format: Create a PowerPoint slide deck.
Presentation Duration: 5 minutes.
Approach: Avoid technical jargon. Use visuals to support your points.

Your presentation should include the following key elements

Project Overview and Value Proposition

#### Objective: Clearly state what you plan to do and why it matters.
Example: We propose a system to identify customers likely to leave in the next few months. By targeting these customers with special offers, we can potentially increase retention by 5% and boost revenue by Â£10,000.
Timeline for MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

#### Duration:
Estimate the time required for each phase of the project, including data gathering, analysis, model building, and deployment.
Example: We anticipate the MVP will take approximately 8 weeks to complete.

#### Success Metrics
KPIs: Define the key performance indicators that will measure the success of your project.
Example: We will track customer retention rates and revenue growth to gauge the effectiveness of our system.
Resource Requirements
Needs: Specify any additional resources you need from the business, such as team members (e.g., web developers, project managers) or technical resources (e.g., hardware, computing power).
Example: We will need access to customer data and support from the IT department to deploy the model.

Feel free to include any other information you believe will strengthen your pitch. The points listed above are guidelines, not restrictions.
